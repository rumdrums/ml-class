Anomaly Detection
. similar to both supervised and unsupervised

. given m examples, is x_test anomalous?
. eg, is user on a website unusual 
. is a particular system unusual?
	given load average
	memory use
	disk writes
	cpu load/network traffic
	-- if p(x) < e is small, may be anomaly

. Gaussian distribution
	x ~ N(u,sigma^2) ~ means "distributed as",
		x distributed normally with mean u and sd = sigma (variance = sigma^2)

	-- u is just 1/m*sum(x^i)
	-- sigma^2 = 1/m * sum(x^i-u)^2
	***	-- machine learners usually use 1/m, instead of 1/m-1
. bell curve formual
	= (1/sqrt(2pi)*sigma)^(-(x-u)^2/(2*sigma^2))

. Pi = Product notation, similar to sigma for summation but each element is multiplied
	by one another
. Given vector x with n dimensions:
	p(x) = p(x1;u1,sigma^2_1)*p(x2;u2,sigma^2_2) ... * p(x_n;u_n,sigma^2_n)
		 = Pi(x_j; u_j, sigma^2_j)
	-- assumes that each x_j is normally distributed and has its own values
		for u and sigma^2
	-- also assumes (loosely) that each x_j is independent

Anamoly detection algorithm
1) Choose features you think might be indicative of anomalous examples
2) Given {x^1,...,x^m}, fit parameters:
	u_j = 1/m * Sum(x^i_j) 
	sigma^2_j = 1/m * Sum(x^i_j - u_j)^2
3) Given new example x, compute p(x):
	p(x) = Pi(p(x_j; u_j, sigma^2_j)
         = Pi((1/sqrt(2pi)*sigma)^(-(x_j-u_j)^2/(2*sigma^2)))
	if p(x) is small, flag as anomaly

Real-number evaluation
. making decisions about what variables to include easier
	if we have way of evaluating algorithm
. Assume we have labeled data, where y = 0/1 if not / anomalous
	-- 10,000 normal examples, training set should be NOT anomalous examples
	-- 20-50 anamlous examples
. taking 10000 normal examples:
	-- training set: 6000
. put your anamlous ones into CV and test with rest of the normals:
	-- cross-validation: 2000 normal, 10 anomalous
	-- test: 2000 good, 10 anomalous
. steps for evaluation:
	1) fit model to training set
	2) on test / CSV sets, predict whether y = 1 or 0
. evaluation metrics:
	classification accuracy is not good -- because y is usually 0
		true positive / false positive / false negative / true negative
		precision / recall
		f1-score
		can also use CV set to choose parameter e
