supervised learning
. "correct" answers already provided
. eg, we already have a dataset where we know relationship between
	house square footage and selling price

regression
. continuous values for dep var

classification
. discrete values for dependent var

unsupervised
. unstructured dataset provided
. clustering algorithms

matrix algebra
. two matrices must be of same dimension to add them, result is same dimension
. mXn matrix * nXo matrix = mXo matrix
. to multiply matrix by matrix, multiply first matrix by each column of the second
. inverse:
	-- some mXm (square) matrices have an inverse, which multiplied by it yields identity 
	matrix
	-- those without inverse are called singular or degenerate
. transpose:
	-- transposing rows and columns


notation
m = number of traning examples (sample size)
(x,y) = single training example

cost function (squared error cost function)
. 1/2 m * summation of squared errors
. aka squared error function
. goal is to find values for intercept and slope that
	minimizes the cost function

gradient descent
. initialize intercept and coefficients to an initial value
. keep changing values until arriving at minimum or local minimum
. values you start with can heavily influence your final estimates
	-- except that, in linear regression, there is always only one 
		minimum 
. alpha = learning rate -- ie the size of the steps you take with
	each prediction
. "batch" gradient descent -- just means that each step in the descent
	looks at all training examples (ie, the mean squared error is calculated using ALL data points in the sample)
